Co-authors: Evan Liu, Xi Yang, Nan Lin, Fiorella Tenorio

### Overview
In this research, we employed distributed systems to explore the similarities in parking ticket records using unsupervised machine learning techniques on a large dataset. Using 37 million ticket records (9 GB) collected by the New York City De- partment of Finance, we applied an algorithm to cluster existing tickets and dive deeper to find the distribution of precincts within different clusters. Amazon Web Services including S3, EC2 and EMR, and tools like MongoDB and Apache Spark were used in this endeavor. In this study, computational time and cost for different EMR settings were evaluated. We conclude that there are significant computational advantages to using distributed systems when implementing unsupervised learning on a large dataset as well as storing and managing data. We also observed that it is time efficient for a cluster with more workers instead of fewer workers with large memory space for the utilized data set. However we observed a trade-off between the execution time and the total cost for the cluster configuration.
